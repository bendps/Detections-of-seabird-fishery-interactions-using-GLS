# Detections-of-seabird-fishery-interactions-using-GLS
This folder contains all the annotated R scripts used in the MEPS paper
"Light-level geolocators reveal spatial variations in interactions between northern fulmars and fisheries"
Here are few instructions regarding the following scripts: 

1.	Scripts are numbered in the order they should be used

2. 	We provide the data for one bird so that it is possible to run the code. 

5. 	We provide only a sample of the fisheries data due to size limitation, the full dataset is available on the Global Fishing Watch website (https://globalfishingwatch.org/data-download/)
